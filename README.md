## Project Overview

Tanks-Online (ATA Systems) is a challenging multiplayer game where players control tanks in an 80s sci-fi military environment inspired by classics like Patlabor and Aliens. Players must cooperatively defend against waves of enemies by placing towers strategically while also avoiding direct attacks from mobs.

### Current Development Status

The project is in early development stages with the following features implemented:
- User authentication system
- Real-time chat functionality 
- Basic game session connection
- Basic player movement and controls

## Project Structure

This repository consists of two main components:

1. **[TanksGame](/TanksGame/README.md)** - Unity-based front end game client
2. **[tanks_backend](/tanks_backend/README.md)** - Spring Boot backend service

## Development Motivation

This project serves as a challenge to create a functioning multiplayer game with a Spring Boot backend. The choice of Spring was deliberate to improve and demonstrate Spring Boot knowledge while applying it to a game development context.

## Visual Style

The game features a pixel art style with an 80s sci-fi military aesthetic, focusing on:
- Retro-futuristic tanks and defense systems
- Moody, atmospheric environments
- Nostalgic visual cues reminiscent of classic sci-fi military media

## Gameplay Concept

In Tanks-Online, players will:
- Control unique tanks with different abilities
- Strategically place defense towers to fend off enemy waves
- Coordinate with teammates to survive increasingly difficult encounters
- Manage resources and upgrade paths for both tanks and towers
- Navigate environmental hazards while battling enemies
